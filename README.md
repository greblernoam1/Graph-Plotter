# Graph-Plotter
This tool allows you to plot graphs
I created classes for performing array operations and plotting functions. It can graph a function represented by an instance of a class that implements the Plottable2D interface

You may choose the default size of the figure and assume that the window will not be resized. You may also choose the number of points at which the function is evaluated in order to generate a smooth-looking plot.

I added:

       a) JComboBox to allow the user to select the color or thickness of the plotted line.
       b) JTextFields to show the limits of each axis and allow the user to change them.
       c) Methods to allow the user to left/right click in the plot area to zoom in/out about the selected point.
       d) Methods to allow the user to pan the plot by left clicking and dragging in the plot area. 
       e) Methods for the user to specify the function to be plotted without modifying source code.
